h3. Installation Notes

<b>Install the plugin:</b>

<pre>script/plugin install git://github.com/rclosner/fusioncharts.git</pre>

<b>Run the tasks:</b> (it will move the necessary files to use the plugin)

<pre>rake fusion_charts:setup    # run from your project's root </pre>

After the installation <b>include the FusionCharts.js</b> in each layout that will render ezgraphix:

<pre><%= javascript_include_tag "FusionCharts" %></pre>

and that's it!.

h3. Usage

<b> In your Controller: </b>

For single series charts:

<pre>
def index
  @c = FusionCharts::FusionChart.new
  @c.data = [{:label => 'ruby', :value => 2}, {:label => 'obj-c', :value => 1}, {:label => 'smalltalk', :value => 3}]
end
</pre>

For multiseries charts:

In this case you have multiple values for each serie. Also you need to specify categories (labels). In the example below there are 2 series "Registrations" and "Payments" and values are divided into 7 months (labels) with a value for each serie/month.

<pre>
def index
  @c = FusionCharts::MSFusionChart.new
  @c.data = { "Registrations" => [4,2,12,7,0,3,6], "Payments" => [7,3,5,2,1,0,9] }
  @c.labels = ["March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September"]
end
</pre>

There are 2 ways to <b> pass render options: </b>

<b>1.</b> When the Chart object is created, you can define it also as:

<pre>@c = FusionCharts::FusionChart.new(:w => 200, :h => 300, :type => 'Column3D', :name => 'my_chart_name')</pre>

The defaults are: <pre>{:type => 'Column3D', :w => 600, :h => 300, :name => 'fusion_chart'}</pre>

<b>2.</b> Anytime you want, by accessing the options attribute.

<pre>@c.options(:caption => 'Cool Languages', :w => 400)  #Merges new options with the last configuration.</pre>

<b> In your view. </b>

Add the following line wherever you want to render the graphic.

<pre><%= render_chart @c %></pre>

<b> Tests </b>

<pre> rake spec#run from the plugin's root </pre>

<b> Note.</b>

Full set of options are specified in the rdoc, and <b>more chart's support will be included soon!.</b>
